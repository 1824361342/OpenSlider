From bottom to top:
1. Roller Carriage (Grey)
2. Belt Mount (Red)
3. Motor Mount (Yellow)
4. Bearing Mount (Grey)


There might be minor differences between the animations and the available .STL files. There is some tolerance in the length of bolts that you can use, so you can usually get away with a slightly longer or shorter bolt than it calls for.

## X-Axis Roller Carriage

3x M5x30mm bolts are used to attach roller wheels to the roller carriage.

On the arm of the roller carriage (The side with only one wheel) there is a slot for an M3x30mm bolt used to tension the X-Axis.
