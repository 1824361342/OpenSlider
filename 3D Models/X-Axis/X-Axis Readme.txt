The X-Axis is made of four main parts. The roller carriage, the carriage body and the mounting plate.

You need to print the roller carriage two times. 
They mount to the bottom of the carriage body using M3 nuts and bolts, and they face in opposite direction.

The belt for the X-Axis fastenes inside of the carriage body, and the mounting plate goes on top. 
The M3 nut cutouts in the mounting plate should face downwards, towards the carriage body.
