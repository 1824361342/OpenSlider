OpenSlider XYZ is a motorized slider with multiple axis of rotation, built using common hardware and 3D printed components.

The goal of OpenSlider is to provide a robust, open source slider platform to fill a variety of needs at a low price point.

The slider is designed with ease of printing and assembly in mind. No support material needed. PETG or ABS is reccomended.
