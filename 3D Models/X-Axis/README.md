The X-Axis is made of three printed parts:
The roller carriage, the carriage body and the mounting plate.

There are TWO VERSIONS of the X-Axis assembly. 

The 2020 X-Axis is designed to run on a 2020 aluminum extrusion, and the 2040 X-Axis is designed to work with a 2040 aluminum extrusion.

The roller carriage is what rides on the 2020 or 2040 rail. Two roller carriages are used.

The carriage body mounts on top of 2x roller carriages, connecting the two carriages together. The belt for the X-Axis connects to the carriage body. There are indicator arrows on the carriage and body to help with alignment. 

The mounting plate goes on top of the carriage body, with a bunch of M3 nut/bolt compatible holes for mounting hardware. The M3 nut cutouts in the mounting plate should face down.

The models are currently being worked on. I don't suggest trying to print them for yourself just yet, they will most likely change.
Stay tuned for a tutorial and bill of materials on the assembly.
