# OpenSlider
OpenSlider is a camera slider, built with common hardware and 3D printed components. It's still a work in progress, and things are constantly changing. I do not suggest trying to print or assemble the slider just yet, since the design is still being refined.

The goal behind OpenSlider is to create a motorized camera slider system with a wide range of motion and functionality that is also affordable.
