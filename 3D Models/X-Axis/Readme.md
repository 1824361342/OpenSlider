From bottom to top:
1. Roller Carriage (Grey)
2. Belt Mount (Red)
3. Motor Mount (Yellow)
4. Bearing Mount (Grey)


There might be minor differences between the animations and the available .STL files. There is some tolerance in the length of bolts that you can use, so you can usually get away with a slightly longer or shorter bolt than it calls for.
