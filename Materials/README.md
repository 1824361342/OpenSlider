## Nuts/Bolts:

An exact list of the nuts/bolts required is coming in the future.

6x M5x30mm Bolts + 6x Nuts for carriage + wheels assembly
M3 bolts + nuts for frame and body assembly

## Frame:

The X-Axis runs along a V-Sot 2040 aluminum extrusion. Use a longer extrusion for more X-Axis travel distance.

The Y and Z axis use printed components.

## Belts

The slider uses GT2 timing belts with 2mm pitch. You can use 6mm or 8mm width belts, whichever you prefer. Two continuous belt loops are required, you can make these by attaching the ends of a straight piece of belt that is cut to the right size.
