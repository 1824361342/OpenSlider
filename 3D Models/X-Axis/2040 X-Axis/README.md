## 2040 X-Axis

These are the models for the 2040 X-Axis. They are designed to run along a 2040 V-Slot Aluminum profile.


## Model Descriptions:

###### Roller Carriage

The roller carriage has 6 wheels that slide along a 2040 aluminum extrusion. The wheels used are 21.5mm OD V-Slot wheels. Use M5 bolts and nuts to connect the roller wheels to the roller carriage. Two M3 bolts can be used to adjust tension on the 2040 rail.

###### Roller Carriage Belt Mount

The belt mount attaches to the top of the roller carriages using M3 bolts/nuts. A GT2 timing belt fits into the slots inside of the X-Axis mount.

###### Motor Mounting Plate

A NEMA-17 motor attaches to the motor mounting plate. The motor mounting plate goes on top of the belt mount.

###### Bearing Mount

The bearing mount goes on top of the X-Axis motor mounting plate. Two 608RS bearings slide onto the shaft on the bearing mount. An M5x10mm bolt with a washer is gently screwed into the shaft to secure the bearings.

###### Generic Mounting Plate

The generic mounting plate can instead of the motor mounting plate if you only desire X-Axis motion. There is a hole centered on the mounting plate that is suitable for an M5 bolt, so you can attach a camera or other hardware of your choice.


###### Idler Pulley End Mount

This attaches to the end of a 2040 profile, and provides a spot to attach an idler pulley for the X-Axis belt.

###### Endcap X-Axis Motor Mount

This attaches to the end of a 2040 profile, opposite to the idler pulley end mount. It provides a place to mount the NEMA-17 motor that drives the X-Axis.
