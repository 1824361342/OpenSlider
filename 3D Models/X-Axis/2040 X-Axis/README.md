## 2040 X-Axis

###### This document is incomplete.

These are the models for the 2040 X-Axis. They are designed to work with a 2040 Aluminum profile.


## Model Descriptions:

###### Idler Pulley End Mount

This attaches to the end of a 2040 profile, and provides a spot to attach an idler pulley for the X-Axis.

###### Endcap X-Axis Motor Mount

This attaches to the end of a 2040 profile, opposite to the idler pulley end mount. It provides a place to mount the NEMA-17 motor that drives the X-Axis.

###### Roller Carriage Double

The roller carriage has 6 wheels, and slides along a 2040 aluminum extrusion to act as the base of the X-Axis. An M3 bolt/nut can be used to adjust tension on the 2040 rail.

###### Roller Carriage Belt Mount

The belt mount attaches to the top of the roller carriages using M3 bolts/nuts. A GT2 timing belt fits into the slots inside of the X-Axis mount.

###### Motor Mounting Plate

A NEMA-17 motor attaches to the motor mounting plate. The motor mounting plate goes on top of the roller carriage belt mount.

###### Motor Mounting Plate Bearing Mount

A very long-winded name. Two 608RS bearings slide onto the shaft on the bearing mount. The bearing mount screw is used to secure the bearings.

The bearing mount connects to the top of the X-Axis motor mounting plate.


###### Bearing Mount Screw

This screw is used to secure the 608RS bearings on the X-Axis assembly. 

After the bearings are placed on the bearing mounting plate, this bolt is screwed into the bearing mounting plate.
