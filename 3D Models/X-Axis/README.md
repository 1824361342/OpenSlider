There are TWO VERSIONS of the X-Axis assembly. 

The 2020 X-Axis is designed to run on a 2020 aluminum extrusion, and the 2040 X-Axis is designed to work with a 2040 aluminum extrusion.

The roller carriage is what rides on the 2020 or 2040 rail.

The carriage body mounts on top of the roller carriages. The belt for the X-Axis connects to the carriage body. There are indicator arrows on the carriage and body to help with alignment. 

The mounting plate goes on top of the carriage body, with a bunch of M3 nut/bolt compatible holes for mounting hardware. The M3 nut cutouts in the mounting plate should face down.

The models are currently being worked on. I don't suggest trying to print them for yourself just yet, they will most likely change.
Stay tuned for a tutorial and bill of materials on the assembly.
