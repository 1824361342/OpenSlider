# OpenSlider
OpenSlider is a camera slider, built with common hardware and 3D printed components. It's still a work in progress, and things are constantly changing.

The goal behind OpenSlider is to create a motorized camera slider system with a wide range of motion that is affordable, adaptable and approachable.
